### Hi there 👋

I’m Edgar Gonzalez, and I live between Albacete(Spain) and London(Uk).

Previously I was a member of the Spanish Paratroopers Brigade “Almogávares” VI, where I served as a Corporal first class (2004-2017).

Why do I like F#? it has a clean and lightweight syntax, is expression-oriented, exhaustive pattern matching, and discriminated unions.
